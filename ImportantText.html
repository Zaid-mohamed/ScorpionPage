        <h1>My Journey into Game Development</h1>
        
        <h2>The Beginning: Zombie Fighter</h2>
        <p>
            My journey into game development began with a simple yet exciting project called <span class="highlight">Zombie Fighter</span>. 
            This zombie survival game was my first venture into creating interactive experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Zombie Fighter, players control a survivor trying to evade endless waves of pursuing zombies. The concept might be 
            simple, but it taught me fundamental game development concepts like:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Player movement and controls</li>
            <li>Enemy AI and pathfinding</li>
            <li>Collision detection</li>
            <li>Score tracking</li>
            <li>Game loop management</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            What made this project special was how it combined HTML5 Canvas for graphics, JavaScript for game logic, and CSS 
            for styling. The zombies spawn from different sides of the screen, creating an intense survival experience where 
            quick thinking and strategic movement are key to survival.
        </p>

        <p>
            The scoring system rewards players for surviving longer, with bonus points awarded when zombies leave the screen 
            without catching the player. This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic where players must decide between 
            playing it safe or trying to maximize their score.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Smooth 360-degree player movement</li>
            <li>Dynamic zombie spawning system</li>
            <li>Progressive difficulty</li>
            <li>Score tracking and display</li>
            <li>Game over and reset functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While Zombie Fighter may seem simple compared to modern games, it represents an important milestone in my 
            development journey. It taught me valuable lessons about game design, user experience, and the importance 
            of starting small but thinking big.
